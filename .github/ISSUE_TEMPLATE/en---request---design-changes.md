1. Name of your project
2. Task description

### Additionally

1. You can specify the urgency of the task in the sidebar on the right. The default setting is "Quickly as possible". Urgency affects the cost. `hr` - indicates the hourly rate. You can find out my current hourly rate [here](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0170447014dabc3e62).
2. As soon as you submit the request "Submit new issue" - I will receive a notification by email.
3. As soon as I start the task, you will receive a notification in the mail.
4. If the process of completing your task takes less than one hour of work - one hour of work is paid. This is why I recommend that you combine multiple issues into a single query.
