# Icons

All icons are optimized using the [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) API. The weight of the icons was reduced by 30-48%. Export settings are specified in [this file](/X/docs/svgo.json).

Icons have been successfully tested on the following platforms: Web, Android, iOS.

## All icons are divided into sections

In this folder, icons are sorted by type - Outlined, Rounded, Sharp. I always use only one icon type per project. You can download icons separately in the following formats: PDF, SVG. All icon types are also available as fonts in the following formats: EOT, TTF, and WOFF.
